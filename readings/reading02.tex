\maketitle

Last week, we saw the precise definition for \textbf{smooth manifold}
in terms of charts and atlases.  This week, we continue translating
our ``advanced calculus'' ideas about $\mathbb{R}^n$ to ideas about
$n$-manifolds.  For instance, we are familiar with tangent vectors;
this week, we learn how to make sense of tangent vectors to a smooth
manifold, even when that manifold does not come embedded in some
ambient space---although we will end the week by showing that our
abstractly defined smooth manifolds \textit{do} embed in some
$\mathbb{R}^n$.

To get started read
\begin{itemize}
\item 1.3 Tangent vectors and tangent spaces
\end{itemize}
from Morita's \textit{Geometry of Differential Forms}.  Armed with a
notion of tangent vector for smooth manifold, we will be able to
define $df$ for a function $f : M \to N$ between smooth manifolds,
which then will permit us to define \textbf{immersions} and
\textbf{submersions}, key notions of differential topology.

And although this week is called ``tangent vectors'' it is really
about much more.  We'll see new examples like real (and complex!)
\textbf{projective space}.  Notions like \textbf{submanifold} will
require careful definitions.  Richer structures on manifolds will make
their first appearance, like \textbf{Lie groups} and \textbf{complex
  manifolds}.  With all this, it still may feel like the ``desert of
definitions'' but important constructions like \textbf{partition of
  unity} will be a brief oasis in that desert.
